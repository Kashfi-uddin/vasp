Step 1:Determination of cut-off energy(ENCUT) and kpoints

Cut-off Energy trial should begin from ENMAX in POTCAR with a fixed kpoints
    • After getting enough data of Cut-off energy vs final total free energy(E0), we have to find a saturated point from the curve and fix the final cut-off energy for our further calculation.
→ Final total free energy(E0) can be get from OSZICAR / type vasp.out
    • After that we have to follow the same path to get the suitable kpoints where trial should be done with the final cut-off energy with respect to different kpoints.



Step 2: Relaxation/Geometry Optimization of the Structure

Input files: INCAR,POSCAR,POTCAR,KPOINTS
    • Create POSCAR from .cif or get from available database(Materials Project)
→ Standardize it by vaspkit (603) and rename it as POSCAR
602--> Find Primitive Cell
603--> Find Standard Conventional Cell
    • Create POTCAR : 
→ cat ~/vasp/potpaw_PBE.64/H/POTCAR > POTCAR
→ cat ~/vasp/potpaw_PBE.64/O/POTCAR >> POTCAR
→ check that all the potentials are set sequentially wrt POSCAR: CTRL+F ( End of Dataset)
    • Create KPOINTS (102) and set the suitable kpoints got from the trial to get more accuracy.
    • Create INCAR (available in the folder)
→ INCAR parameters should be same always for the structure to any calculation
    • Run
→ for run: mpirun -np 36 vasp_std
→ for non-collinear spin mode: mpirun -np 36 vasp_ncl




Step 3: SCF optimization

Input files: INCAR,POTCAR,KPOINTS,CONTCAR from geometry optimization
    • copy the required input files from geo_opt folder
→ cp INCAR POTCAR KPOINTS CONTCAR ~/vasp/…../scf
(CONTCAR is the relaxed structure file)	
    • rename CONTCAR as POSCAR 
→ mv CONTCAR POSCAR
    • Run
Step 4: Determination of the BAND structure and DOS

Input files: INCAR,POTCAR,POSCAR,CHGCAR,WAVECAR from scf optimization
    • copy the required input files from scf_opt folder
→ cp INCAR POSCAR POTCAR CHGCAR WAVECAR ~/vasp/…../band
    • create KPATH.in(303) and rename it as KPOINTS
→ mv KPATH.in KPOINTS
    • RUN 
    • Get the band structure data (211)
    • Get the dos data (111)

For hybrid calculation: 
    • Do hybrid scf_opt
→ same as mentioned earlier just with hybrid INCAR(available in the folder) 
    • Create KPATH.in (303)
    • Generate KPONTS(251)
    •  RUN
    • Get the band structure data (252)
    • Get the dos data (111)
  

                 
Step 5: Determination of the mechanical properties

Input files: INCAR,POSCAR,POTCAR,KPOINTS(accuracy should be good enough: 0.01) 
    • Prepare VPKIT.in file and set the value of first line to 1  
1                    ! 1 for pre-processing; 2 for post-processing
3D                   ! 2D for two-dimentional, 3D for bulk
7                    ! number of strain case
-0.015 -0.010 -0.005 0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015  ! Strain range
    • After that to get 
→ Elastic-Constants Using Stress-Strain Method (200) [faster and preferable]
→ Elastic-Constants Using Energy-Strain Method (201)
    • Do batch Run all the elastic constants created in a folder
    • Modify the value of the first line in VPKIT.in file to 2 
    • Get all the mechanical data (200/201)





Step 6: Determination of the optical properties

Input files: INCAR,POTCAR,POSCAR,KPOINTS,CHGCAR,WAVECAR from scf optimization
    • copy the required input files from scf_opt folder
→ cp INCAR POSCAR POTCAR CHGCAR WAVECAR KPOINTS ~/vasp/…../optical
    • RUN
    • Get the optical properties data (71)
