ISIF:

For Full Geometry Optimization (relax both ions and cell shape): CONTCAR =! POSCAR
ISIF = 3: This relaxes the atomic positions, cell shape, and volume, and calculates the stress tensor.

For Relaxing Only Atomic Positions (keeping cell shape and volume fixed):
ISIF = 2: This relaxes the atomic positions while keeping the cell shape and volume fixed. It also calculates the stress tensor.

For Electronic Structure Calculations Only (no relaxation):
ISIF = 0: This is used for static SCF calculations where no relaxation is performed.
